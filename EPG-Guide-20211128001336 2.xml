<title lang="en" >What Would You Do?</title>
<desc lang="en">Using hidden cameras, host John Quiñones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc>

<desc lang="en">Created in 1997 by veteran journalist Barbara Walters, "The View" is a daytime talk show hosted by women -- including Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Sara Haines -- and each offers her take on the day's news during the opening "Hot Topics" segment. Later, the ladies welcome various celebrities, who join them in a chat or perform for the audience. The program also offers tips on beauty, fashion, diet and relationships. Known for their freewheeling style, the hosts are often lampooned in late-night sketches.</desc>

<desc lang="en">Sidelined by a nasty cold and feeling unneeded, Santa decides not to make his annual Christmas journey. Elves Jingle and Jangle scour the world to find people who still believe, hoping to convince the jolly old elf to make his trip anyway. They run into trouble in Southtown, however, and the only way they can get out of their predicament is to make it snow in the warm climate. Meanwhile, Santa sees evidence that people do still believe, and a little girl's touching letter prompts him to pack up the sleigh and head out on his annual trek, making a special stop in the now-snowy Southtown.</desc>

<title lang="" >Grit: Honey Badger Tough</title>
<desc lang="">This film intimately follows the story of a single female honey badger as she raises her cub to independence. Weaving in the parallel stories of black backed jackal and pale chanting goshawk we examine their unique association with honey badger. And as a backdrop, the unique tapestry of the Kalahari unfolds - one moment harsh and forbidding, the next a glorious, wildly remote haven for some of Africa's most special animals.

Executive producer Michael Davies ("Watch What Happens Live," Jerry Seinfeld's "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee") says by booking celebrity guests and opinionated national and local journalists, and taking advantage of a close collaboration with all 32 NFL franchises, "Good Morning Football" should break out within and well beyond its time period.</desc>

When ESPN launched the SEC Network in 2014, it was only natural that Finebaum became its first on-air hire, bringing his radio show -- and those passionate followers -- with him. Now originating from one of the SEC Network studios in Charlotte, N.C., the show is a forum for lively discussion and debate of all things SEC and across the spectrum of college sports, with Finebaum playing the role of both moderator and provocateur. The show airs weekday afternoons throughout the year on SEC Network.</desc>

<desc lang="en">Veteran writer, reporter and radio personality Paul Finebaum built a legion of loyal sports fans as the "Voice of the SEC" during 20 years hosting his Birmingham, Ala.-based radio talk show. When ESPN launched the SEC Network in 2014, it was only natural that Finebaum became its first on-air hire, bringing his radio show -- and those passionate followers -- with him. Now originating from one of the SEC Network studios in Charlotte, N.C., the show is a forum for lively discussion and debate of all things SEC and across the spectrum of college sports, with Finebaum playing the role of both moderator and provocateur. The show airs weekday afternoons throughout the year on SEC Network.</desc>

<title lang="en" >Frosty the Snowman</title>
<desc lang="en">Based on the popular song with the same title, this holiday classic tells the story of a snowman named Frosty, brought to life by a magic hat. As the temperature begins to rise, Frosty worries that he'll melt, so his human friends come up with a plan to put him on a train to the North Pole, where he'll never melt. But the owner of the magic hat, Professor Hinkle, realizes it's really magic, after all, and wants it back. As they journey toward the North Pole, the cold takes its toll on Frosty's human companion, Karen, and he seeks help from none other than Santa himself, who takes Karen home, Frosty to the North Pole and shames Professor Hinkle into letting Frosty keep the cap.</desc>

<desc lang="en">Based on the beloved children's book by Dr. Seuss, "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" follows the exploits of the title character who is infuriated by the celebration he sees down in Whoville each year at Christmastime. He vows to stop it and -- dressed as Santa -- drives a sleigh into town on Christmas Eve, removing all traces of the impending celebration. He watches gleefully from his perch on the mountain above, sure that when the Whos awake and see that their holiday decorations, gifts and feast are gone, they will be sad. To his surprise, the Whos celebrate anyway, leading to an unexpected response from the Grinch.</desc>
